Work in the apartment

An electrician in an apartment is like air or clean water: when everything works as it should, we don’t pay attention to the power grid at all and don’t think about how it works. And only after the appearance of malfunctions, small or large, we understand: without electricity we are very uncomfortable. And we are looking for professional electricians.

Electrical services in the apartmentWiring work in the apartment is the supply of electricity to each room and the connection of all appliances: both household and necessary for the normal functioning of the electricity network (for example, automation and meters).

The main requirements that we make to the electricity network of the apartment:.

    Safety and reliability.
    A sufficient amount of electricity for the operation of all devices.
    Ease of use of the network (for example, a sufficient number and proper location of sockets and switches).

It is simple to call an electrician of the Two Electrics company, our experts will perform all the necessary work accurately and accurately. As a result, you will not have problems with lighting, household appliances will work, as expected, each outlet will be operational, the switches will be exactly where they are most convenient to use, and the Internet, telephone and cable television will always be available.

##Work in the house

Electrical work in the house To the power supply system of a country house, you can make the same requirements as for the network of a city apartment or office. But the electrician of a country house is a more complex system than a network in a single apartment. Indeed, in the cottage, it is necessary, in addition to standard household appliances, to connect an electric pump for local water supply, heating and ventilation systems, an alarm system, etc. Therefore, only high-class professionals should design a country house system and carry out electrical work.
It is important that it is necessary to calculate the layout of household electrical appliances and lighting sources, choose electrical equipment and cables for the cottage depending on the materials from which the house is built.

For example, more stringent requirements must be imposed on an electrician in a wooden cottage than on the same system mounted in a concrete cottage or in a brick mansion. After all, wood is a more fire hazardous material than concrete or brick. And here it is especially important to carry out all electrical work carefully and accurately so that there is not even a conditional possibility of fire due to faulty wiring.

    Only qualified specialists work in our company, performing all work in strict accordance with the rules and safety standards.

##Electrical services for wiring replacement

Electrical services to replace old wiringReplacement of wiring is one of the most popular services. For example, in the old city fund, it is necessary to lay a new one instead of its worn out and unable to cope with the loads of wiring.

Before replacing the wiring, it is necessary to draw up an accurate design of the electrical network. Well, then ditch the walls and lay the cable, make wiring and make connections.
To get rid of a huge amount of wires in an apartment or office, cables are often laid in cable channels and corrugated pipes. Durable boxes not only hide the wiring from the eyes and help get rid of the web of various wires, but also protect the cable from mechanical damage.
What determines the price


For those who order electrical work, prices are not the last value. There is a rule that is familiar to all of us: the avaricious pays twice.

    Electrical work is the complete power supply of the room, the installation of lamps and the connection of equipment. If necessary - installation of emergency lighting and additional power supplies plus installation of electrical safety systems. The final cost depends on the complexity of the project and the work performed, as well as on the quantity and quality of the materials and equipment used.
